Thank you for reading the prologue to my story! Hopefully, everything made sense since it was meant to set up the plot for my novel. 

The rest of this story will mainly take the perspective of Claude and his party (Fiore, Estelle, etc.) who seek to investigate the events that occurred here, so stay tuned for more chapters (if I donâ€™t get lazy). Writing is simply a hobby for me, but it is also my dream to make an entertaining story for people to enjoy.

So again, thank you all for showing support!
