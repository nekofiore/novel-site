The assistant director standing at the front of the room pointed to several locations on the map of the nation. Each of the locations were marked as "points of interest", given that there is evidence that a single perpetrator had committed a murder in each of these areas.

*Sigh... This is so boring...*

"You all understand that this is serious enough to be classified as a nationwide emergency. This is why I've brought you all here to help us in our investigation efforts."

I took a glance around me, to see the room full of veteran witches and magic users. It wasn't a surprise, given that this nation's pride is built upon their leading research in magic and innovation in magic technology.

"As the Assistant Director of the National Magic Association, I welcome everyone here to the investigative branch of the Magic Association. The urgency is at an all time high, and we will be expecting to hear the results of everybody's efforts towards this cause..."

The briefing continued to go on for a while. I simply just spaced out, not paying attention. All of this information was already too familiar to me, since I've already been lectured about it many times before.

Dozing off, I simply let my eyes close shut, and just sat still for the rest of the talk.

After a few moments, the briefing has finally reached its ending.

"...and that will signify the end of this briefing. You are all dismissed."

Everyone in the room rose up and showed a subtle sign of gratitude, before they filed out of the room one by one. After everyone exited the room, I was still slumped in my chair, too unwilling to even stand up.

"Claude. The briefing's over. You can get up now."

I grudgingly put my hand on my desk to prop myself up straight.

"You know its unnecessary for me to listen to the same talk over and over again..."

The lady turned off the panel, walked towards the desk with a stack of documents on top of it.

"The details of the mission could change with every meeting, so I always make an effort to make sure everyone is updated on such information. After all, it is your duty as a captain to ensure you have the latest and most accurate information needed to carry out your task." 

"But you can just give me the new details without the rest, you know. Besides, I'm always the youngest person in the room by a *far* margin. I feel quite out of place."

She picked up the documents and tapped the stack onto the table to tidy them. She then summoned a crystal out of thin air, as the documents rapidly flew and fused into the crystal.

"I understand your concerns fully well. However, that briefing was not the main reason as to why I brought you here anyway."

"So what was?"

The lady flipped a switch behind her that closed all of the doors and windows shut. No light could even seep in or out of the room.

The panel display then promptly turned on in a dim blue hue. On it displayed a map of a small town, housing a dozen or so buildings. Towards the right hand side was a a thick forest, which had subtle markings of annotations scribbled over a few areas.

"I'm temporarily assigning your team to a another mission of highest urgency."

She rolled through the slides on the panel, cycling through pictures of the forest floor from the ground level.

"On these markings are signs of hidden hideouts located deep within the forest. Our intelligence sources say that there is a high-value target that must be brought back in one piece. Failure to do so will result in serious consequences."
