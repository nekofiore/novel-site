#### What is Visualization?
Information that can be visualized in any way (text, signs, graphics, etc.)
- For the purposes of this class, it will most likely refer to data that can be graphically visualized, such as charts, graphs, and etc.

It is important to ensure that your graphical representation of data is 
- For example, if you are plotting x and y points, make sure the axes are scaled in order to represent what is going on in a clear way (everything is not compressed and etc.)

#### Representing Data with Visualization
There are many ways to express data through visualization, whether it be maps, graphs, and etc.
- Maps can give a lot of information, since you can map data to specific places within the map, and along with characteristics of those areas, you can form conclusions or probable causes for a said event.
- Graphs can show a change of a value over a metric (most commonly time) or another independent variable. These can be used to identify relationships between data.

#### Visualization vs. Computer Graphics
- **Visualization** is essentially trying to represent data through visualization for the purpose of analysis.
- **Computer Graphics** is essentially working with rendering graphics on displays just for the sake of presenting graphical objects (games etc.)
	- A common computer graphics pipeline is going from:
		- 3D Data -> 3D World Coordinates -> Canonical View Volume -> 2D Display Coordinates (ray tracing) -> Person
#### Datasets
Data doesn't have to necessarily be represented or compared in only x and y values. You can make use of keys, 3D data, and etc. in order to convey even more information.
- An example in scatterplots is to map an x and y, and a possible z variable as a key for each dot, representative of a shape (like square, triangle, circle, etc.)
