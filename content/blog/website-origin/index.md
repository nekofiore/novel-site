You are probably curious as to why you are here. Before I can explain, I'll have to answer this question for you:

### Why did **nekofiore** come into fruition?

Well, I simply needed a place to store all of my stuff. At first, I had all of my writing stored in a collection of [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UX4xSuvPid230LC3HUVcs6Phn3zwQTn8hSwtLq9wr0Q/edit?usp=sharing), but it was kind of awkward to share. My customizability was limited to displaying all of my of content into pages becauseâ€”well, that was Google Docs was made for.

However, I eventually wanted to expand into making a comphrehensive wiki-like collection for all of my creations. I never intended to only share pages, but rather galleries of art, lore, and possibly games. All of which my previous methods were not fit to do.

So, after deciding to pick up some web development, I finally started to get to work on **nekofiore**. My vision for this website will come in three steps:
1. Creating a static site that is meant to hold a collection of documents and literature (its current phase). Static portions of the website are meant for my novel, blog posts, and any other document that is not intended to be changed or updated in realtime.
2. Adding more dynamic features, such as user comments, profiles, and more interactive components to the site. This will be the part where I'll actually get to make some fun stuff (maybe drag & dropping characters in certain places for easter eggs);
3. Lastly, I want to integrate some sort of game (or multiple) into here. The first idea would be to make a multiplayer game in which people share invite links over this site, and participate in some sort of leveling system (for the purpose of displaying flair!).

I will dive much deeper into these topics in future blogs, but for now I'll leave the reader to these small tidbits to digest.

Hopefully
