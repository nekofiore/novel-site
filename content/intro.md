Welcome to the landing page of **nekofiore**!

This site will mostly be used to host all of my creative projects, mainly my novel, **"The Secret of Two Witches"**.

If you are familiar with my work, then you must already be familiar with one of my main characters, <span style="color: #ff759aff">**Fiore**</span>! The identity of **nekofiore** revolves around her, flowers, and pets that I adore: **cats**! She was one of the first characters I designed and extensively created lore around, so she is definitely a character that is held dear to my heart.

Start with browsing through my **diaries** below!
