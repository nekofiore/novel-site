    <h4 id="what-is-visualization">What is Visualization?</h4>
<p>Information that can be visualized in any way (text, signs, graphics, etc.)</p>
<ul>
<li>For the purposes of this class, it will most likely refer to data that can be graphically visualized, such as charts, graphs, and etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to ensure that your graphical representation of data is</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, if you are plotting x and y points, make sure the axes are scaled in order to represent what is going on in a clear way (everything is not compressed and etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="representing-data-with-visualization">Representing Data with Visualization</h4>
<p>There are many ways to express data through visualization, whether it be maps, graphs, and etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maps can give a lot of information, since you can map data to specific places within the map, and along with characteristics of those areas, you can form conclusions or probable causes for a said event.</li>
<li>Graphs can show a change of a value over a metric (most commonly time) or another independent variable. These can be used to identify relationships between data.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="visualization-vs-computer-graphics">Visualization vs. Computer Graphics</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visualization</strong> is essentially trying to represent data through visualization for the purpose of analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Computer Graphics</strong> is essentially working with rendering graphics on displays just for the sake of presenting graphical objects (games etc.)
<ul>
<li>A common computer graphics pipeline is going from:
<ul>
<li>3D Data -&gt; 3D World Coordinates -&gt; Canonical View Volume -&gt; 2D Display Coordinates (ray tracing) -&gt; Person</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="datasets">Datasets</h4>
<p>Data doesn&rsquo;t have to necessarily be represented or compared in only x and y values. You can make use of keys, 3D data, and etc. in order to convey even more information.</p>
<ul>
<li>An example in scatterplots is to map an x and y, and a possible z variable as a key for each dot, representative of a shape (like square, triangle, circle, etc.)</li>
</ul>
