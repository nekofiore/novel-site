## Biography
Fiore grew up in the countryside, and consistently trained from a young age to become an incredible duelist. Her mother was a well-accomplished alchemist, and her father was a magnificent blacksmith.

Fiore has a love for any type of scenery that involves nature or vibrant flora. She would spend most of her time outdoors in the forests near her home, training and resting beside her favorite pond and retreat.

### Point of the Flower?
Naturally, Fiore has a heightened sensitivity to the environment around her, which allows her to understand where everything is around her simultaneously (almost like a sixth sense). However, continuous exposure to this sensitivity causes strain on her eye, which drains her energy and can cause the eye to burst.

To help with her condition, Fioreâ€™s mother picked out one of her favorite flowers and imbued it with a spell that limited but eased her senses. Fiore found it most comfortable to wear the flower over her left eye, hence the reason she always keeps it on during her day-to-day life.

She also wears the flower in honor of her mother, who perished in an ambush overseas when Fiore was 13.
